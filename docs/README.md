# OctoAcme Project Management Processes

OctoAcme runs projects through a lightweight, stage-gated lifecycle that prioritizes small, shippable increments and clear ownership. Projects move from Initiation (one-pager, stakeholder alignment, and go/no‑go), into Planning (kickoff, prioritized backlog, estimates, and Definition of Done), followed by Execution (build, test, review, iterate), Release (deployment, verification, rollback plan), and Close & Retrospective. Key artifacts — Project One-pager, roadmap/release plan, sprint backlog, risk register, acceptance criteria, and retrospective action items — are maintained in the project repo as the single source of truth.

Operational workflows emphasize clear board state and a disciplined PR process: a project board with Backlog → Ready → In Progress → In Review → QA → Done; small pull requests with linked issues and acceptance criteria; automated CI checks (tests, linting, security scans) before review; and at least one approval before merge. Planning activities include backlog prioritization, T-shirt/story-point sizing, explicit dependency capture, and weekly syncs to surface cross-team dependencies and risks.

Roles are explicitly defined so responsibilities are clear: Product Managers set vision, success metrics, and prioritize the backlog; Project Managers coordinate schedules, risks, and stakeholder communications; Developers implement and test features; and QA/Testing owns validation and acceptance. Regular communication cadence includes daily standups, sprint planning, demos/reviews, weekly PM+PdM syncs, and monthly stakeholder updates to reduce ambiguity and speed decision-making.

Quality assurance and release practices are tightly integrated: automated unit, integration, and end-to-end smoke tests run in CI, security scanning is required pre-merge, and manual QA is used for acceptance when needed. Releases follow pre-release checklists (release notes, rollback plans, staging smoke tests), automated deployment pipelines where possible, and an incident playbook with clear rollback and notification steps. Risks are tracked in a simple register and escalated via a tiered path (Team → PM → Product Lead → Sponsor), and retrospectives turn learnings into tracked action items for continuous improvement.
